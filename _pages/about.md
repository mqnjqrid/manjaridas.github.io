I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Statistics and Data Science. I am working under Professor [Edward H. Kennedy](http://www.ehkennedy.com/) on capture-recapture problems. I have completed my Bachelor's and Master's from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata in 2014 and 2016 respectively. I am inetersted in nonparametric statistics, methodology development, causal inference and network analysis. I am interested in working with challenging data sets and in modifying methods to fit the data.

Thesis:

I am working on total population size estimation problems, also called capture-recapture problems, using a nonparametric approach. In our first project in this, we presented an improved efficient and doubly robust estimator of the total population size under heterogeneity. In the second project, we are working in a very general capture-recapture set-up with weak assumptions. This set-up ensures only partial identifiality and we used sensitivuty approach. In the third project, we plan to estimate the total population size as a function of some continuous covariate. This is similar to conditional average treatment effects in the causal inference literature.
