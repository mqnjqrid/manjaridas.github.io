I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Statistics and Data Science. I am working under Professor [Edward H. Kennedy](http://www.ehkennedy.com/) on capture-recapture problems. I have completed my Bachelor's and Master's from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata in 2014 and 2016 respectively.


I am working on non-parametric estimation in total population size estimation problems, also called capture-recapture problems.
