This was part of my Dietrich Teaching Fellowship. I got the opportunity to teach and hold workshops for two weeks on basic statistical topics. The first topic was variable transformation for which I designed the lecture notes and created some shiny applications (available in the shiny_apps repository on my Github account) for interactive learning. The second topic was Bootstrap and some practical applications.
