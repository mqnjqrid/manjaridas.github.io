This is a six week long course offered in summers. The topics include basic ideas of statistics, random variables, estimation, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. I was involved in partially designing the lecture notes and assignments. I held lectures Monday to Friday every week and also conducted flexible doubt clearing sessions. Apart from this, I also worked with a team of six teaching assistants and handled the logistics. I am grateful to Professor Peter Freeman and my fellow student Matteo Bonvini for sharing their resources and for the very helpful guidance.
