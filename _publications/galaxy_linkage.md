title: 'Linking galaxies to their progenitors based on galaxy morphology'
collection: publications
date: "April, 2018"
excerpt: We analyze the statistics of galaxy data from the Illustris Project at different time points, and we use these results to build models that predict the past mass rank of a galaxy given its current mass rank, morphology, and physical properties such as star-formation rate.
