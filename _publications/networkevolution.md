This paper models the edge formation in a Google+ sub-graph by modelling the distance between two nodes based on their number of shared covariates. The final generated graph is then compared to the actual graph to measure the validity of the assumption that a person's (node) behavior can be explained by his/her connections (1-hop nodes).
